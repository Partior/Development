File folder /CurrentWork/ contains the most recent codes for developing a V-H diagram for an aircraft utilizing propwash over a majority of the wing span.

  As of Version 3.6, 27 JAN 2016, files within /Current/ are and have the following functions:

V-H&Fuel_Eff/v_h_propwash.m

  Main Script file current analysis of aircraft
  Calculates and graphs a Velocity-Height Diagram of the aircraft defined by prop_const.m (Constants)
  Calculates and graphs a fuel-economy contour
  Calculates and graphs stall lines, AoA for level flight, max possible level N-Turn, as well as reference 250 and 300 mph lines

Takeoff/takeoff_wash.m

  Main Script for takeoff analysis
  Calculates takeoff distance
  Calculates OEI takeoff distance
  Determines descion for emergency braking point
